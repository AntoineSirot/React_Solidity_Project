# How to launch my project :

To launch it you have to go to the ux_tderc721_app folder and use the "npm start" command to start my application on your navigator. 

After that I suggest that you test my functions in the order of the project so you won't have any problem.

(PS : It's possible that the Fake BAYC images doesn't load due to your connection. In this case you should connect your machine in 4 or 5g and it'll work)


# My Project :

This is a project I did based on React and Solidity understanding. 

The subject of the project is from another repo : https://github.com/AymericNoel/erc721-ux

I had a lot of fun implementing functions to use NFT's URI and playing with contracts to find how to mint without being whitelisted.

If you begin in React this is a really good project to start because the difficulty increase at every exercise and every function could be usefull is real life project.
